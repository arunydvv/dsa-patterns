# ðŸ“Œ Depth-First Search (DFS) 

**DFS (Depth-First Search)** is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.  
It uses a **stack (explicit or implicit via recursion)** to track exploration paths.

DFS is ideal for problems where you need to:
- Visit all nodes in a connected component
- Detect cycles
- Traverse paths deeply before moving to neighbors

| Backtracking possible               | Yes â€” returns control to a previous node after exploring its neighbors                       |

## âœ… Standard DFS Code (Java)

### ðŸ“Œ Recursive DFS

```java
import java.util.*;

public class DFSTemplate {
    void DFS(int node, boolean[] visited, List<List<Integer>> adj) {
        visited[node] = true;

        for (int neighbour : adj.get(node)) {
            if (!visited[neighbour]) {
                DFS(neighbour, visited, adj);
            }
        }
    }
}

```

### ðŸ“Œ Iterative DFS (using Stack)

```java
import java.util.*;

public class DFSTemplateIterative {
    void DFS(int source, boolean[] visited, List<List<Integer>> adj) {
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        stack.push(source);

        while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
            int node = stack.pop();

            if (visited[node]) continue;
            visited[node] = true;

            for (int neighbour : adj.get(node)) {
                if (!visited[neighbour]) {
                    stack.push(neighbour);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

## âœ… Summary

DFS is one of the most powerful and flexible graph traversal techniques, ideal for exploring connected components, cycle detection, path enumeration, and tree operations. Its recursive nature makes it a natural fit for problems where depth-first exploration is needed.

----------

## âœ… DFS Limitations

-   May cause **stack overflow** for very deep recursion (can use iterative DFS in such cases)
    
-   Not suitable for shortest path problems in weighted/unweighted graphs (use BFS/Dijkstra instead)

## âœ… Time Complexity

-   **O(V + E)**  
    (V = number of vertices, E = number of edges)

## âœ… Final Tip

Always remember:  
ðŸ‘‰ DFS explores as deep as possible before backtracking  
ðŸ‘‰ Recursion stack can overflow â€” iterative DFS is an alternative  
ðŸ‘‰ Track visited nodes carefully to avoid infinite loops  
ðŸ‘‰ Useful for trees, connected components, and cycle detection
