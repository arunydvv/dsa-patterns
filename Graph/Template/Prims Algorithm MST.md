Prim‚Äôs Algorithm is a **greedy algorithm** that builds the MST by:

-   Starting from any node.
    
-   At each step, picking the **minimum weight edge** that connects a new node to the growing MST.
    
-   Repeating this until all nodes are included in the MST.
    



## üìå Core Idea:

Use a **PriorityQueue (Min-Heap)** to efficiently get the next smallest weight edge.

----------

## üìå Standard Java Implementation (with PriorityQueue)

### ‚úÖ Code:

```java
import java.util.*;

class Pair implements Comparable<Pair> {
    int distance, node;
    Pair(int d, int n) {
        this.distance = d;
        this.node = n;
    }

    @Override
    public int compareTo(Pair other) {
        return this.distance - other.distance;
    }
}

class Solution {
    static int spanningTree(int V, int E, List<List<int[]>> adj) {
        int sum = 0;
        PriorityQueue<Pair> pq = new PriorityQueue<>();
        pq.add(new Pair(0, 0));

        boolean[] inMST = new boolean[V];

        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            Pair current = pq.poll();
            int node = current.node;
            int distance = current.distance;

            if (inMST[node]) continue;
            inMST[node] = true;
            sum += distance;

            for (int[] next : adj.get(node)) {
                int neighbour = next[0];
                int nextWeight = next[1];

                if (!inMST[neighbour]) {
                    pq.add(new Pair(nextWeight, neighbour));
                }
            }
        }

        return sum;
    }
}

```

## üìå Time and Space Complexity

Operation

Complexity

**Time**

`O(E log V)`

**Space**

`O(V + E)`

**Why?**

-   Each edge can be pushed into the PriorityQueue.
    
-   PriorityQueue operations take `O(log V)` time.
    
-   Each node is processed once.
    

----------

## üìå Input Graph Format

Use **Adjacency List** representation:

```java
List<List<int[]>> adj = new ArrayList<>();
for (int i = 0; i < V; i++) adj.add(new ArrayList<>());

adj.get(u).add(new int[]{v, weight});
adj.get(v).add(new int[]{u, weight});

```

## üìå Important Variants & Notes üî•

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Lazy Prim‚Äôs (Standard one you just saw)

-   Uses a `PriorityQueue<Pair>` and a `boolean[] inMST`.
    
-   No need to decrease keys ‚Äî just add possible options to the queue.
    
-   Skip already visited nodes.
    

**Advantage**: Simple to implement.

----------

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Eager Prim‚Äôs

-   Uses a **PriorityQueue (min-heap)**, but with an additional `key[]` array to track the current minimum weight to reach each vertex.
    
-   You update the key value when you find a better option.
    
-   Requires either:
    
    -   Custom decrease-key support in PriorityQueue (hard in Java)
        
    -   Or simulate via re-adding with updated key and skipping worse ones.
        

**Example C++ implementations usually prefer this.**

----------

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Prim‚Äôs with Path Construction

-   Store parent information to reconstruct the actual MST edges.
    

```java
int[] parent = new int[V];
Arrays.fill(parent, -1);

```

And update:

```java
parent[neighbour] = node;

```

Then, later traverse `parent[]` to list MST edges.

----------

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Disconnected Graphs (Multiple MSTs)

If the graph is disconnected:

-   Prim‚Äôs will only process one connected component.
    
-   If required to get total MST weight for all components:
    
    -   Run Prim‚Äôs repeatedly on unvisited nodes.

## üìå Notes

- **Prim‚Äôs Algorithm**
  - Best for dense graphs because it picks the cheapest edge from a set of connected nodes efficiently using a Priority Queue.
  - Often implemented with an adjacency list and a min-heap for optimal performance.

- **Kruskal‚Äôs Algorithm**
  - Works well for sparse graphs as it sorts all edges first.
  - Uses Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) to detect cycles when adding edges to the MST.
