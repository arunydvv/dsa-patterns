## ðŸ“š  Problems Checklist

### 2 Search in a Binary Search Tree [[700](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-a-binary-search-tree/description/)]

-  **Recursive Approach** â€” Recursively search left or right subtree based on value.  
   TC: O(h) / SC: O(h)

-  **Iterative Approach** â€” Loop through tree nodes, move left or right based on value.  
   TC: O(h) / SC: O(1)

---
### 2 Find Min/Max in BST

-  **Iterative (Go Left for Min, Right for Max)** â€” Keep moving left for min or right for max until null.  
   TC: O(h) / SC: O(1)

-  **Recursive** â€” Recursively move left for min, right for max.  
   TC: O(h) / SC: O(h)

---
### 3 Ceil in a Binary Search Tree (Ceil = smallest value â‰¥ target)

-  **Iterative BST Traversal** â€” Traverse BST, move left if node â‰¥ target (update ans), else move right.  
   TC: O(h) / SC: O(1)

-  **Recursive BST Traversal** â€” Same logic as iterative but using recursion.  
   TC: O(h) / SC: O(h)

-  **Inorder Traversal + Linear Scan** â€” Do inorder traversal (sorted array), then find first element â‰¥ target.  
   TC: O(n) / SC: O(n)

---
### 4 Floor in a Binary Search Tree (Ceil = largest value <= target)

-  **Recursive Approach** â€” Traverse left/right based on node value vs target, track possible floor.  
   TC: O(h) / SC: O(h)

-  **Iterative Approach** â€” Similar to recursive, but with a loop to avoid recursion stack.  
   TC: O(h) / SC: O(1)

---
### 5 Insert into a Binary Search Tree [[701](https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-into-a-binary-search-tree/description/)]

-  **Recursive Approach** â€” Traverse recursively to find insert position.  
   TC: O(h) / SC: O(h)

-  **Iterative Approach** â€” Use a loop to find insert position without recursion.  
   TC: O(h) / SC: O(1)

-  **Morris Traversal (Threaded BST)** â€” Not commonly used for insert, but possible for traversal with O(1) space (rare).  
   TC: O(n) / SC: O(1)

---
### 6 Delete Node in a BST [[450](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-bst/description/)]

-  **Recursive Approach** â€” Recursively find the node, replace with inorder successor/predecessor if needed.  
   TC: O(h) / SC: O(h)

-  **Iterative Approach** â€” Use while loops to locate and delete node, handle cases for 0, 1, or 2 children.  
   TC: O(h) / SC: O(1)
