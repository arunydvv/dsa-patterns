# Algorithm Patterns Repo 🚀

Hey there! 👋

I made this repo to help you learn and practice **algorithm patterns** — like Greedy, Binary Search, Sliding Window, Recursion, and more.

---

## Why this repo?

There are tons of problems out there, and it’s easy to get lost. This repo groups problems by **patterns** so you can focus on the technique, not just random problems.

---

## How to use this?

- Pick a pattern you want to learn.
- Try solving a few problems from that pattern **(no need to solve them all!)**.
- Understand the common tricks and approaches behind each pattern.
- Use the problems to practice and get better step-by-step.

---

## Tips for solving problems 💡

- Start simple — pick easy problems first.
- Don’t rush — understand why a pattern works.
- Read editorials if stuck, but try yourself first!
- Practice regularly to build confidence.
- Write clean, easy-to-read code.

---

## That’s it

I hope this helps you become a better problem solver. Feel free to contribute or suggest new patterns and problems.

Happy coding! 🎉
